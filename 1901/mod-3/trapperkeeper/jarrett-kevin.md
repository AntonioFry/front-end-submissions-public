* Functionality is niiiiiiice

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all requirements above and implements one or more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Server side

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and all endpoints are tested (both happy and sad paths).
