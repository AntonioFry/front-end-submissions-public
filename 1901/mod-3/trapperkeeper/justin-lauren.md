### Evaluator: Leta
### Students: Justin, Lauren, Sally
### Comments:

- UX is odd; can't hit "enter" for a new list item field, can't check items from homepage, can't add or delete fields from a note that's already been created
- Redux architecture solid
- Testing is thin (async, component, server-side); Redux testing is in place

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing part of one or more of the features outlined above. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and concise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests for Redux and React are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.

### Redux Architecture

* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Server side

* 3 - Application hosts all required endpoints, and an effort has been made to test them.
