### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 2.5 - Nearly all unit tests for Redux and React are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### Server side

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and all endpoints are tested (both happy and sad paths).
