## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all requirements above without error. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits. Project shows a basic understanding of React.

### Testing

* 3 - All Redux functionality is tested (actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps), all components are unit tested, and a valid attempt was made to test any async functionality.

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).
* 3 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.

### Server side

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and all endpoints are tested (both happy and sad paths).
