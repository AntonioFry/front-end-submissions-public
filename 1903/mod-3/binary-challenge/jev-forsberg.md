### Comments:

* YESSSSS using PRs!
* Consistent commit messages
* Nice README
* Redux store is flat and doesn't contain redundant data
* Opening screen is DELIGHTFUL
* Route name (criminals) is very in line with the tone of the app, and HILARIOUS
* 404 page includes link back to app - nice
* mapStateToProps test should begin with state that contains too much info, so you can ensure mSTP only pulls in the data you ask for
* Good tests

## Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and concise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

### Redux Architecture

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and no duplication of data exists in the store. Data in the store remains flat (not nested).

### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.
