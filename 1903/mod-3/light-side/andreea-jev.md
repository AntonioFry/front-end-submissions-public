### Comments:

* Ooh fancy with favoriting
* LOVE the conditional rendering in Card!
* Good component tests!  Not just snapshots! Hooray!
* Good isolated fetch test
* Tests in App.js around async stuff need a bit more thoroughness (making sure state updates on mounting, etc)


## LightSide Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.
* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more
  than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits.
  Project shows a basic understanding of React.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are
  passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).
