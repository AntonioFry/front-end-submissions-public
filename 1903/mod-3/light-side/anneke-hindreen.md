### Evaluator: Leta
### Students: Anneke, Hindreen
### Comments:

* Overall good use of components
* Router is solid (no 404 page)
* Solid approach to conditional rendering
* Component testing mostly in place (missing some functionality - ex: a method calls another method)
* Async tests in place
* Some component testing still needed (make use of manual mocks), ex: componentDidMount in App.js
* Smaller commits to document more specific changesets
* Work on syntax (indents, spaces, line breaks, etc)

## LightSide Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All requirements from 2 are met and a valid attempt to test asynchronous functionality has been made.
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
