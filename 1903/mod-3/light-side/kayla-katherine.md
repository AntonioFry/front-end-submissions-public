### Evaluator: Travis Rollins
### Students: Kayla Larson & Katie Lewis
### Comments:
* Nice work pushing for those extensions
* Would recommend lower casing the route
* Double check the bug with local storage
* Points for breaking out the fetches and cleaner files
* Would recommend using conditional over try catch with setting storage
* Great work with the Card component displaying the data
* Could recommend catching errors using .catch() as well as response.ok
* Spend more time unit testing and writing asynchronous tests!  
  * Test all fetch calls, cleaner tests, etc.  Test multiple sad paths.
  * Test for events happening and multiple paths based on conditional rendering.
* Might recommend including a 404 page if user doesn't go to a route you intended
* Great number of commits, be consistent being descriptive with your commit messages
* Great work requesting reviews, would recommend leaving more comments/communication on code

## LightSide Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 1 - A valid attempt to test this application was made, but there are obvious gaps, with missing unit tests.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
