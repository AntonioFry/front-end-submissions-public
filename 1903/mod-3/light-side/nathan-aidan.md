### Comments:
* Great user experience, showing the correct components for each route, double check css on bigger screens
* Awesome work only fetching data when I need to
* Wouldn't recommend checking the window's link, the click of the navigation
  * Utilize the match or location object in the Route to find what your path is
* Breaking out cleaner functions into it's own file just like fetch calls
* Would recommend not including logic in return statement
* Shouldn't need to check routes since BrowserRouter is handling that logic for us
* Would recommend using a 404 page if the user doesn't go to a route you are handling
* Good number of commits, would like to see more conversations on PRs.
