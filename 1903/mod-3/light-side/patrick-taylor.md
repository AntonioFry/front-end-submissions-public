### Evaluator: Leta
### Students: Taylor, Patrick
### Comments:

* Some redundancy in App (is there a way we can be more agnostic with the routes?)
* Nice job with the updatePage agnostic function
* Can clean up conditional rendering in App (combine into blocks)
* Testing: App.js - updatePage needs more test (test that it's setting state with parsed data, test that it's setting state with an error)
* More thorough tests for component methods are needed (updating state, etc)
* Nice job taking a shot at testing async stuff (good job pulling into separate files)
* Good job on commits and PRs
* Hooray we learned to do code reviews
* Linting could be tighter

Overall notes:
* Overall component structure is solid
* More practice needed with conditional rendering
* Determining where logic lives/who knows what/who is in charge of what/etc is still in progress

## LightSide Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 4 - All requirements from 3 are met. The application completes all iterations above and implements one or  more of the extensions. And the evaluator has no recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All requirements from 2 are met and a valid attempt to test asynchronous functionality has been made.
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
