### Evaluator: Travis Rollins
### Students: Ryan Flachman & Evan Markowitz
### Comments:
* Great work handling the routes
* Love the UI, might think about what is hoverable and what is clickable
* Think about when we need to display the Previous and Next buttons (likely don't need it on favorites)
* Keep looking into the bug with the favoriting toggle on the favorites page
* Think about when you need to fetch the data as opposed to fetching it all at once
* Keep setState inside of the components
* Awesome work cleaning out the data from the objects
* When passing information down, likely redundant to write out the exact attributes you need
* Double check that you have .catch on all promises
* Awesome work testing the toggleFavorite, look into testing changePage to make sure state is updated as well
* Great work testing out some of the async functionality, would continue testing out other data like vehicles & planets
* Would test out more simulation unit tests like clicking on a button and making sure the correct data is being passed through
