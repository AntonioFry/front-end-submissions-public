### Evaluator: Leta
### Students: Steve, DeMarcus
### Comments:

* More commits - currently, not enough commits, which means changesets being documented are too large, which can be bad if you need to rewind to an earlier commit - you might lose changes you didn't know you are losing
* Async testing is missing testing the response/error
* Component tests still thin: need to test that state updates (with fetches), need to test cleaners in App.js
* Nice job on conditionally rendering stuff without much redundancy

## LightSide Rubric

### Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal
  recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter
  errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized
  wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to
  branches, and use descriptive and consise commit messages. Project
  demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.

### Testing

* 3 - All requirements from 2 are met and a valid attempt to test asynchronous functionality has been made.
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.

### Routing

* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
