### Students: Vinton Te'o & Emily Dittmer
### Comments:
* Would recommend separating cleaning functionality into their own function/files
* Really nice work with your Card component using the keys and values
* Would recommend creating a new variable as opposed to updating a prop
* Great work with conditional rendering and handling of routes
* Great work testing the toggling of favorites, might break those tests out to test addFavorite, removeFavorite on their own
* For testing purposes, test that the data is what I expected it to be as opposed to the length
* Might include a 404 page if route doesn't match
