### Evaluator: Leta
### Students: David, Vinton, Taylor
### Comments:

* YAY PROPTYPES
* Great Redux testing
* Make sure to move containers into the containers folder - it's low hanging fruit!
* Redux architecture looks pretty good - but don't store redundant data (only store IDs in Favorites array rather than whole movie objects)
* Component tests are very solid
* React architecture looks good
* No 404 handling, doesn't break though

## Rubric

* 3 - The application completes all iterations above without error. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

### Project Professionalism

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a complete mastery of React architecture.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).

### Redux Architecture
