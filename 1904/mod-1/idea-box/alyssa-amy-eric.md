## Notes/What To Work On:
Really strong work - excited that you had a great team dynamic! 


### Functional Expectations

*  Novice: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.
*  Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

Have most of Phase 2 working - don't have filtering/searching implemented. 

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

Great attention to detail on spacing and positioning! Media queries were generally really solid and we discussed a few areas for improvement, but overall great job.

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

Really clean HTML structure and great use of semantic elements! 

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

CSS was very well structured and group members could speak to organizations decisions. Few repetitive lines of code and solid use of media queries. 

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements

Code was well organized and clean. Great job using a clickHandler() to reduce event listeners on one area. All group members could speak well to code decisions. We discussed a few areas for improvement, especially around passing global varialbes into class methods instead of relying on files to speak to one another.
