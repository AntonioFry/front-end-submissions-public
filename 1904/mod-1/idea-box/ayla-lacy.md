## Student: Ayla and Lacy
## Evaluator: Eric Weissman
## Notes/What To Work On:
- Make sure to do adhere to style guide before final submission
- CSS and HTML is in a really solid place for this part of the mod - continue to prioritize JS on your final project and be aware of how to work towards acheiving functionality for later phases. That being said, good job of rationalizing and explaining your decisions for the workflow and project mgmt.

### Functional Expectations

*  Novice: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.

Prioritized all functionality in Phase 1 and did not have time to get to Phase 2. Have a lot of the peices in place to get Phase 2 working quickly.

### Comp Recreation


*  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth
*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

The comp recreation is really solid. Good job with trying to tackle some media queries - we reviewed some areas that were a little choppy/clunky and discussed some ways to improve the comp, but overall solid work. This landed somewhere between Advanced Beginner and Proficient. 

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

HTML was clean and well structured. We mentioned a few instances where the naming conventions got a little inconsistent, but very well named for the most part and easy to read!

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules

Provided reasoning for their organization structure. We discussed some opportunities to refactor CSS a bit (including some commented out code, duplicate rules, shorthand for some properties). Good job of organizing rules wihtin selectors and use of media queries. A few spacing/styleguide issues we discussed as well.

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods

JS was solid but didn't meet all expectations for Proficient. We discussed some areas to refactor and both of you did a good job of talking through the code you had written. You mentioned times where you refactored your code to make things more DRY. Looking forward to seeing your progress on the next project!
