## Student: Brianna DelValle & Chris Lane
## Evaluator: Travis Rollins
## Notes/What To Work On:
* Great number of commits & branches!
  * Good work with consistency of commit messages and keeping them bite sized.
* Make sure it fills up the entire space
* When there is only 1 card or 2 cards, I would have them appear in the top left
* Great work with the search functionality having it search through cards of that quality
* Things move up just a little bit as shrinking the screen
* With the menu in mobile view, some things are off centered just a bit
* Also would double check to make sure inputs are same widths as cards
* Nice work with keeping the html structure pretty clean and using mostly semantic tags
  * Might use a header for the title
* Good organization of styles and alphabetizing properties
* Might experiment with short-hand versions of styles
* Several areas where we could group styles that share similar classes together
* Experiment with other ways you can target elements aside from classes
* Do we need to store the qualityArray every time in the constructor?  See how we could make this more local
* Awesome work with the bracket notation in your updateIdea
* Good work breaking out functions into smaller pieces
* Experiment with toggle method on classList (relating to the menu)
* Start to look into truthy & falsy
* Would stick to filtering through the your ideasArray as opposed to the DOM array

### Functional Expectations

  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
