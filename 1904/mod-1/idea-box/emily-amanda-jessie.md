## Student: Emily, Amanda and Jessie
## Evaluator: Eric Weissman
## Notes/What To Work On:
Be able to explain the code you wrote clearly. If you are having trouble explaining how it works, that should be a sign that you may need to dive back in or refactor. 


### Functional Expectations

*  Novice: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.
*  Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

Have some of the functionality of phase 2 working but some things are not functioning properly.

### Comp Recreation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth
*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

The comp is pretty aligned, however we mentioned a few areas where the resizing and media queries were a little jumpy. We discussed a few areas where there were issues with alignment/spacing, but overall solid work.

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

HTML was well organized and naming conventions were solid. We discussed a few areas where it was a little <div> happy, but you were able to defend you decision. I still think you can get away without divs simply for styling reasons.


### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules
*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

Styles/rules were well organized and you could speak to your decisions. We discussed how a few more media queries would have been helpful. 

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
  
 The JS was clean and well organized. We discussed areas where naming was a little wonky and there were a few times when you were unable to speak on how the code was working. Perhaps it was nerves, but be sure that you can clearly articulate your decisions to implement code a certain way.
