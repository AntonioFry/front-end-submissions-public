## Notes/What To Work On:

### Functional Expectations

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.
- All of phase one is complete, but error handling of phase 2 is still a work in progress. A few parts of Phase 3 are complete, but we discussed making sure all functionality of a phase is complete before moving on.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop only (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment, etc.)
- some issues with spacing and alignment
- attempts at media queries but still some unusual behavior as we resize the screen
------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Crafts markup according to the [turing html style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html)
- Instances of nested divs and not always using semantic tags
- Good job of only using two forms!

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts CSS according to the [turing css style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css)
- No coherent organization to style sheet
- Multiple instances of overriding styles and duplication
- Too much styling of elements rather than utilize classes to handle smaller adjustments
- Solid attempt at media queries!

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts JS according to the [turing js style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
- A lot of opportunities to DRY up code - oppurtunitites to break out larger functions into smaller helper functions, using parameters to make functions more dynamic
- Discussed issues with naming functions - if it is hard to describe exactly what a function is doing, it's probably a sign that your function is doing too much and could be broken out!
- Good organization of variables, event listeners and then functions!
