## Notes/What To Work On:
* GREAT number of commits and messages.  Cheers!
  * Also good number of branches, try and be consistent ("test" branches)
* Fun things with animations.  
* Careful of spacing on cards 
  * Missing the word "guesses" to explain how many guesses there are
* Spacing between buttons could be evened out a little more
* Great user experience and streamlining the process after a user wins
* Also very good error handling
* Some issues with spacing on responsiveness
  * Button's text (Submit, Reset, Clear) get a little cut off around 1070px
  * Cards width could be same width as forms above
  * Title and text in inputs could be a little bigger to match the content
* For organization reasons, keep inline functions out of your HTML
* Would recommend having all challenger info and buttons in one form
* Might include a little more heiarchy in the guess sections 
* Would separate animations separate from styles similar to media queries
  * Also some animations are repeated twice like "scale-in-center", "slide-in-elliptic", etc.
* See how you can do less micro-managing in your media queries
* Careful of having multiple event listeners on an element
  * Have one event listener on an element that fires multiple functions
* Great passing arguments through for the guessMesageHelper and toggleErrorHelper function
* Great work on breaking functions out into smaller pieces
* Great use of bracket notation for the konami codes


### Functional Expectations

* __Exceptional:__ Application adds three or more of the extensions from phase four.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements and:
  * Keeps functions DRY with a focus on SRP and can call functions within functions
  * There are no nested if/else statements
