## Notes/What To Work On:

### Functional Expectations
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
- The functionality of Phase 2 is mostly complete, but there is still some issues with the error handling. We reviewed potentially refactoring the error handling functionality that would likely push this to a full Advanced Beginner. Overall, really solid landing spot for functionality. I think before diving into the Phase 3, ensure that all parts of the previous phases are completely bulletproof.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.
- Some issues around spacing and font choices.
- Utilized media queries to handle shrinking of screen in mobile/tablet view.
- Pay attention to all details of comp to ensure that you have all loose ends buttoned up.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.
- Overall really solid HTML, there were some times where there were a lot of `<div>`s that could maybe have been tightened up using semantic tags or reorganizing HMTL to take advantage of CSS.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness
- Style sheet was fairly well organized and incorporated section comments and alphabetization
- Implemented a few media queries succcessfully, may need to add/adjust to handle smaller screen sizes
- Some issues with indenting 

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
- Good job of using parameters/arguments to make functions more dynamic
- Discussed some opportunities to refactor functions that are repeated over and over by making them more dynamic
- Discussed making sure to name functions appropriately
- A few global variables that were unnecessary (particularly the error variables)
