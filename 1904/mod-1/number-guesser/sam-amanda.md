## Notes/What To Work On:


### Functional Expectations
* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
- got all of Phase 1 and some of phase 2. You did some work on soem of the Phase 3 functionality before finishing all of phase 2. In the future, make sure your phases are completed and bulletproof before moving on to next phase.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner/Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.
- Really strong attention to detail in regards to the comp
- Most of the media queries are really effective, we discussed a few instances where there may not be a need for a media query but overall really strong here

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.
- HTML was well structured and made good use of semantic elements
- Great job only using two forms!
- HTML was easy to read and follow

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness
 - Style naming conventions were strong
 - We discussed a few instances where we could potentially combine classes into one
 - Good use of implementing media queries aside from one that is a little sketchy!
 - Well organized as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling

- Discusserd opportunities to use parameters more effectively to make function more dynamic
- Good job using parameters for evaluating the guess
- discussed refactoring some functions that have repetitive code
- JS was overall pretty clean and well named
