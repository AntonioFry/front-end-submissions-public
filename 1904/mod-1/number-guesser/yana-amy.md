## Notes/What To Work On:

### Functional Expectations

* __Novice:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase one.
- Got most of the functionality completed for phase 1 and were beginning to start Phase 2

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.
- solid work recreating the comp, a lot of good attention to detail on some of the nuances of the comp
- some unusual white padding/border around the page that needs to be cleaned up. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Novice/Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.
- pushing closer to a full Advanced Beginner
- a few instances of using unnecessary divs/nesting
- good use of semantic elements!

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts CSS according to the [turing css style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css)
- Not responsive - didn't get to implement media queries
- Good job of organizing styles and being able to articulate your decisions for doing so!
- A few instances of duplicated classes that could have been condensed into one
- Need to make sure that the app takes up the entirety of page (weird spacing around top right of page?)

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts JS according to the [turing js style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
- Base functionality is there, however, we discussed a lot of opportunities to DRY up code by using parameters and arguments
- Had multiple event listeners on the same elements, would be better suited calling functions within other functions to have only one function per event listener
- Although the functions were small and modular (good!), want to take advantage of calling functions within other functions!
