## Notes/What To Work On:
- Everyone did a great job talking through the pieces they worked on!
- See some opportunities to clean up JS file - inconsistent semi-colons, whitespace, an unused function,
- JS naming - make sure function names are verbs
- Using a map when a forEach could do the job

### Functional Expectations

*  Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
 - Everything works ðŸ’¯, no bugs at all
 
### Comp Recreation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth
 - missed some small details, fonts on buttons, some font sizing, button width on form,
 
### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Exceptional - Application adds to the above by using BEM, SMACCS, or another set of naming conventions for classes
  - Basically perfect, style and syntax wise. So easy to read and follow. Alphabetized within rules.
  
### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
