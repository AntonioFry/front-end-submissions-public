## Student: Kirk, Eric and Colin
## Evaluator: Eric W.
## Notes/What To Work On: Really strong project - was excited to hear that your workflow/communication process was a driving force in your group dynamics. Very good attention to detail on the comp recreation and the decisions to utilize a collapsable menu for smaller screen sizes created a very pleasing user experience. The Idea class was well constructed and we discussed using params in some of the methods to pass an array more dynamically to account for potential adjustments to project down the line. The JS overall was really solid and you did a good job of articulating your choices for manipulating the data. Good use of event delegation/handlers to keep event listeners to a minimum.

### Functional Expectations

*  Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward


### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
