## Student: Naomi, Victor & Sara
## Evaluator: Eric W
## Notes/What To Work On: Really proud of how your group navigated a rocky start and pulled together to create a functional project. HTML and CSS were really solid. As we discussed, let work on tightening up the JS to utilize more params to DRY up code and make functions more dynamic. A lot of the 'heavy lifting' was happening in your main.js and we want to utilize more of the methods in our actual Idea class. We also discussed trying to move our event listeners "higher" and utilizing event delegation/handlers to fire when certain conditions are met. Excited to see your progress on these points in your final project! 

### Functional Expectations

*  Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

### Comp Recreation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth
*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward


### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions
*  Exceptional - Application adds to the above by using BEM, SMACCS, or another set of naming conventions for classes and:
  *  Implements html that is accessible for folks with visual disabilities.

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
*  Exceptional - Application adds to the above by using BEM, SMACCS, or another set of naming conventions for classes

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
