## Student: Peerat, Noah, Matt
## Evaluator: Holt
## Notes/What To Work On:
- Clean code overall, everyone was able to articulate what it was doing.
- upvote/downvote functions are about the same - refactor opportunity
- using map where forEach should be used

### Functional Expectations

*  Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
 - Doesn't appear to have any bugs, great job making sure search can work with current cards (if filtered by quality, for exampl)
 
### Comp Recreation

*  Exceptional - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements that have been added match the visuals established in the comps

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
