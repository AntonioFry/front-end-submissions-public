## Student: Brady, Chris, Pol
## Evaluator: Holt
## Notes/What To Work On:
- no space under search bar on desktop, need some padding around icons on top and bottom bar of each card
- All group members did a great job

### Functional Expectations

*  Proficient: Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.
 - Quality up and down vote is currently broken
*  Exceptional: Application adds all of the extensions from phase four.

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions
 - Used BEM, indentation, data - attributes, all looks good
 
### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines ðŸ›‘
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
*  Mostly Exceptional - Application adds to code quality by refactoring all for loops into the proper array prototype iteration methods and:
  *  Uses logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable
  *  Uses arrow functions, block scoped variables, and destructuring correctly.
  *  When 'Filtering and Searching by Text' and 'Filtering by Importance', ideas that do not need to be shown on the dom should be completely removed from the dom, instead of only being hidden from view
