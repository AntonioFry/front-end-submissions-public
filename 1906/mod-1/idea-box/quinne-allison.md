## Student: Quinne & Allison
## Evaluator: Eric W
## Notes/What To Work On: Solid project! HTML and CSS was clean - we discussed some areas that could use a little tweaking, such as having the media query kick in a little sooner and looking for some red flags such as `<div>` wrapping a single element. Also, try to avoid having JS directly in your HMTL when possible! Good work on getting the functionality of Phase 2 mostly working - we discussed how we can clean up the filter functionality by lower-casing the search input text. The Idea class overall was good, we discussed making better use of params to allow our methods to be more flexible, but great job of passing in the array we want to update. Be sure to pay attention to some of the styleguide/spacing/indenting issues to ensure that everything is buttoned up before turning it in! Overall, great work! 

### Functional Expectations

*  Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

### Comp Recreation

*  Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by using appropriate semantic elements and using `data-*` attributes for all data related things
*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions


### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Advanced Beginner - Application adds to the above by correctly implementing a data model for the `Idea` class including all required methods
*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
