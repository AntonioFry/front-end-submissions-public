## Student: Roger, Garret, Foster
## Evaluator: Holt

## Notes/What To Work On:
- Everyone did a great job talking through their pieces!
- put hover states for cursor on clickable things
- missing some small details - quality not centered vertically, title of card not bold,
- don't have anything in your codebase if you don't know what it's doing
- Keep your JS readable - break things out into variable if you have a line over 80 characters
- JS is hard to read because of inconsistent indentation - looks like one team member may have settings for tab to be 4 spaces?
- Look at style guide - you have some `if(conditions)` and some `if (conditions)`. Get it consistent!
- Think about the content a complex data type is holding - `globalArray` isn't very helpful; I can see it's an array in the global scope. Maybe `allIdeas` or something like that

### Functional Expectations

*  Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
 - Also completed 2 of the 3 requirements of Phase 3.

### Comp Recreation
 
*  Advanced Beginner - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth
 - There is a media query for 860px and 490px - font sizes got smaller but form and buttons remained the same percentage so just got really small, seemed sloppy/half-hearted.

### HTML - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions
  *  Implements html that is accessible for folks with visual disabilities.
 - Has a meta tag in head that no one knows what it's doing.
 - Had two indentation issues.

### CSS - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
- looks clean and organized, consistent style within the sheet and avoided repetition. Used ems.

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

*  Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions and:
  *  Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements for deleting, editing, & starring an idea
  *  All functions are less than 10 lines
  *  There are no global variables aside from query selectors and two arrays for your ideas and qualities
  *  There are no nested if else statements
