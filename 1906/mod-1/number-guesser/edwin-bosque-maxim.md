## Notes/What To Work On:
- DRY up JS
- Great job collaborating! 
- HTML and CSS great, very thoughtful
- Great reflections on what they'd do with more time, what they learned

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Novice:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop only (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment, etc.)
- Most of it was there, but they chose to focus on functionality for a merge over some styles.
- Layout is in place and a lot of attention to detail was given

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
