## Student: Kate & Mike
## Evaluator: Eric W.
## Notes/What To Work On: 
Functionality wasn't where it needed to be to get a super accurate read due to some issues that occurred toward the end of the project. We discussed working on consistency with naming across CSS classes, etc. and attention to detail re: style guide. The JS had some areas we identified to DRY things up by utiziling helper functions. We also discussed ways to improve gameplan and execution for future projects.
