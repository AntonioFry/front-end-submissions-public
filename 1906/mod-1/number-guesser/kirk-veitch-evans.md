## Student: Kirk & Jeannie
## Evaluator: Eric W. 
## Notes/What To Work On: It sounds like you had a great workflow that allowed you both to learn from one another and you built a very solid project. The HTML structure and CSS organization is solid and we discussed some small CSS tweaks (whitespace underneath on larger screens, some spacing in media queries, etc.) The JS had several opportunities to DRY code up using args/params and ways we can reduce using so many comparison operators in one block of code. Overall, solid work! 

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.). Transitions between screen sizes may not be smooth.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation
* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds organization for the whole stylesheet and within rules and
  * Has 5 or less media queries for responsiveness
* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Novice:__ Crafts JS according to the [turing js style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
