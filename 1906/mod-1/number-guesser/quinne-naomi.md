## Notes/What To Work On: 
The attention to detail on the comp was evident and the UI was very well executed across multiple screen sizes. CSS was well executed and only had a few examples of duplicate styling, which ties into some of our discussion around tightening up the HTML structure. Solid job on achieving all of the functionality of the first two phases and getting some of phase 3 going. The JS definitely had several opportunities to refactor to make more DRY (using handler/named functions in event listeners, calling functions within other functions/breaking out functions, and using parameters to make functions more dynamic) but good attention to adhering to style guide. Good job making small commits and using branches.

### Functional Expectations
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.


------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation
* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application adds to the above with HTML that incorporates semantic HTML elements and has a simple, clean HTML structure.
* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions


------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation
* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness
* __Exceptional:__ Application adds to the above by using [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [SMACCS](https://smacss.com/), or another set of naming conventions for classes

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
