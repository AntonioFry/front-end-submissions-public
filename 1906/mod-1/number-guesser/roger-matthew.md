## Student: Matthew & Roger
## Evaluator: Holt
## Notes/What To Work On:
- Would like to see hover states on buttons when enabled
- HTML looks relatively semantic and organized
- Not using forms because of default refresh - need to find out how to handle that
- Don't leave comments or any un-used code on your master branch
- CSS should be organized at least alphabetically if not idiomatically
- If you're going to use something you know is a bad practice, at least ask about a better way, don't just say it was the only way you could figure out.
- Roger had some great reflections on general architecture, but yes, some functions are too long and need attention. Encourage you to balance clean code with levels of functionality.
- Use semi-colons consistently in JS
- Declare named functions and call in event listeners

Learning Goals for next project: 
- Roger - cleaner code, HTML and JS - reflect on lessons, best practices
- Matthew - org structure, what times partner work/collaborate, schedule by-whens to complete, make sure we all learn

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
