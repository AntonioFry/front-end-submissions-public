## Student: Sam & Eduardo
## Evaluator: Holt
## Notes/What To Work On:
- Beautiful comp recreation, couple small things you also pointed out to improve, but overall ðŸ’¯
- Great breakpoint transitions
- Look into idiomatic styling
- You don't need to use the `window.onload`!
- Event Listeners can live in global scope, don't need to be inside function
- Work on DRYing up JS - some opportunities to refactor!

Focus on Next Project:
- Sam - make JS DRY, cleaner, learn ways to refactor
- Eduardo - more reps to get practice to condense, 

### Functional Expectations

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.
- PLUS can delete cards

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Exceptional:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements that have been added match the visuals established in the comps.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Advanced Beginner:__ Displays good understanding of arguments vs parameters and:
  * Uses function declarations over anonymous functions in event listeners
  * Uses if/else statements to handle multiple paths of logic/error handling
