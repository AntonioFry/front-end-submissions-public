## Notes/What To Work On:
- Recreation of comp looked solid, winner cards needed a little more attention to padding and font case.
- Consider UI - added in names on DOM but still required user to type in name again, confusing as a user
- Dont' add class names if you aren't going to use them to target in CSS or JS
- Make sure to remove comments from HTML; your code should speak for itself
- Upcase fonts with CSS
- Keep an eye on consistent white space between CSS rules and indentation
- Function naming - make sure it calls for action
- When adding innerText, make sure it's in an HTML element
- JS style and syntax looks great
- Great README!
- Make sure to push up DS_Store

### Functional Expectations

* __Proficient:__ Application meets all of the expectations of phase three.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comp Recreation

* __Proficient:__ Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment,  etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### HTML - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follows across naming conventions

------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle and
  * Has 3 or less media queries for responsiveness

------------------------------------------------------------------

### JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation

* __Proficient:__ Application uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements and:
  * Keeps functions DRY with a focus on SRP and can call functions within functions
  * There are no nested if/else statements
