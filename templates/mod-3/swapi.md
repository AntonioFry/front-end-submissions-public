### Project Professionalism

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, codebase has zero linter errors/warnings and readme contains screenshots of application. Project team uses a rebase workflow, taking advantage of github issues to track work. Project shows a complete mastery of React architecture.
* 3 - PropType functionality is complete, the codebase has less than 5 linter errors, README has been updated with all group members. Project utilized wireframes from the outset. All git commits are atomic, made first to branches, and use descriptive and concise commit messages. Project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of React architecture.
* 2 - Project is missing PropTypes, README updates, wireframes, or has more than 5 linter errors. Project team makes large infrequent git commits. Project shows a basic understanding of React.
* 1 - PropTypes are substantially unused, README is incomplete, wireframes were not used, or more than 10 linter errors are present. Git history does not show evolution of project, with many large and inconsistent commits. Project shows little understanding of React and significant refactoring is required.

### Testing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, all async functionality is tested, tests are passing and run efficiently (using mount only when appropriate).
* 3 - All requirements from 2 are met and a valid attempt to test asynchronous functionality has been made.
* 2 - Nearly all unit tests are in place. No attempt to test async functionality was made.
* 1 - A valid attempt to test this application was made, but there are obvious gaps, with missing unit tests.


### Routing

* 4 - All requirements from 3 met, and always chooses the correct component for rendering, as well as the correct Route API. Application should account for undefined routes.
* 3 - Application uses React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
* 2 - Application uses React Router, but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.
* 1 - Application uses React Router, but does not render/use all routes.
